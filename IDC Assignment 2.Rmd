##IDA ASSIGNMENT TWO

```{r}
#Code based on workshop 3, question 2, model answer

#First load the required data
load("dataex2.Rdata")
#If you do not have maxLik installed, please un-comment the below line to do so
#install.packages("maxLik")
require(maxLik)

#Define our log likelihood function
log_like_q2 = function(param, data){
  #Values for x and r are given by the input
  x = data[,1]
  r = data[,2]
  #mu will be the parameter we're calculating the mle for
  mu = param[1]
  #Plug in the equation worked out earlier
  #Note the norm function has an argument log, which if true gives the output as a log, so by taking the log there we don't need to take the log of the phi's again
  sum (r*(dnorm(x, mu, 1.5, log = TRUE)) + (1 - r)*(pnorm(x, mu, 1.5, log = TRUE)))
}

#Now using the maxLik package we optimise the MLE to get our answer
mle_q2 = maxLik(log_like_q2, data = dataex2, start = (mu = 1))
summary(mle_q2)
